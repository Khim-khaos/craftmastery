# CraftMastery User Guide

## Introduction
CraftMastery is a mod that adds specializations and progressive recipe unlocking to Minecraft. This guide will help you understand how to use the mod's features.

## Specializations
There are three specializations available:
1. Technical
2. Magical
3. Magtechnical

To choose a specialization, use the `/craftmastery` command or interact with the Specialization GUI (if available).

## Experience and Levels
You gain experience by performing various actions in the game. As you gain experience, your specialization level increases, allowing you to unlock more recipes.

## Unlocking Recipes
Recipes are unlocked based on your specialization and level. You can unlock recipes in two ways:
1. Automatically as you level up
2. By using Knowledge Books

## Knowledge Books
Knowledge Books are items that unlock a random recipe for your current specialization. To use a Knowledge Book, simply right-click while holding it.

## Commands
- `/craftmastery give_points <player> <amount>`: Gives experience points to a player
- `/craftmastery remove_points <player> <amount>`: Removes experience points from a player
- `/craftmastery give_reset_points <player> <amount>`: Gives reset points to a player
- `/craftmastery reload`: Reloads the mod configuration
