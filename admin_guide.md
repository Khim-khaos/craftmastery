# CraftMastery Admin Guide

## Configuration
The mod's configuration file is located at `config/craftmastery.cfg`. You can modify various settings such as experience gain rates and maximum levels.

## Commands
As a server operator, you have access to the following commands:

- `/craftmastery give_points <player> <amount>`: Gives experience points to a player
- `/craftmastery remove_points <player> <amount>`: Removes experience points from a player
- `/craftmastery give_reset_points <player> <amount>`: Gives reset points to a player
- `/craftmastery reload`: Reloads the mod configuration

## Balancing
You may need to adjust the following aspects for game balance:
1. Experience gain rates for different actions
2. Required levels for unlocking recipes
3. The power and rarity of Knowledge Books

## Performance Considerations
The mod should have minimal impact on server performance. However, if you notice any issues, please report them to the mod author.

## Compatibility
CraftMastery should be compatible with most other mods. If you encounter any conflicts, try adjusting load orders or consult the mod author.
